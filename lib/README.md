## Library
This folder contains [React components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component#components-ui-building-blocks) and utility modules that are specific to the project (not available as a dependency package).

> :bulb: If one of the modules or components inside this folder could be used by several other projects, it may be a good idea to move it to its own repository and serve it from there as a npm package.
