# GLDT landing page

This folder contains the source code for the GLDT landing page deployed on https://gldt.org
.  
As the front-end will be hosted on the Internet Computer, this projects uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs) and bundles a full static website with [client-side fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side).

> :bulb: This project uses the [`pages` routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure#pages-routing-conventions), and not the [`app` routing that just went out of beta](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4#nextjs-app-router).

See [main README](../README.md) for more informations.
